# Stone-Paper-and-Scissor
A non UI based popular game program for beginners.

## About the game

It is a game which is played between two people, in which each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with an outstretched hand. These shapes are "stone" (a closed fist), "paper" (a flat hand), and "scissor" (a fist with the index finger and middle finger extended, forming a V also indicating "victory").

**RULES:**

It has three possible outcomes: a draw, a win or a loss. A player who decides to play stone will beat another player who has chosen scissor ("stone crushes scissors" or "breaks scissors"), but will lose to one who has played paper ("paper covers stone"); a play of paper will lose to a play of scissor ("scissor cuts paper"). If both players choose the same shape, then the game is draw.
